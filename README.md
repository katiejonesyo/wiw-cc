<!-- Hello! I was only able to put in 1.5 hours worth of work given my schedule. I feel it is not my best work BUT I did manage to get a great start. If I had more time I would have put in error handling, made up proper testing, and finished up my RegularHours code. So far what I have is the output receiving the employeeID number, startOfWeek, and AllHours(which would be RegularHours and Overtime once finished but they are not broken up yet). I also noticed <empty items> in my output and would have liked to have had the time to figure that out more. I fixed the data typos. I would love to clean up and refactor my code if I get the chance to revisit this. Overall, I see a lot of potential for personal growth with this challenge and would love to finish it. Quite the head scratcher!-->
