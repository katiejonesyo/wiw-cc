If I had more time I would have put in error handling, made up proper testing, and finished out my RegularHours code. So far what I have is the output receiving the employeeID number, startOfWeek, and AllHours(which would be RegularHours and Overtime once finished) but they are not broken up yet. I would love to clean up and refactor my code if I get the chance to revisit this. Overall, I see a lot of potential for this and would love to finish it. Quite the head scratcher!-->",
